# py3status
## an i3bar status line in python 3.

A simple alternative to i3status or i3blocks, this program's principle is to have each element of the status line be a python class with a basic interface, polled by a controller class.

The emphasis is on **total user control** and **code transparency**, followed in time with a performance tightening. This application is geared toward those *willing and able to program python* to configure it. This is much in the spirit of [XMonad](http://xmonad.org/), except with fewer catamorphisms.

### writing a new unit

To add a new unit, derive the PY3Unit class and override the three core methods:
- `read`
- `format`
and, optionally,
- `handle_click`

`read` takes no argument and produces a dict of output values. Output what you please, and these values will be processed by the `format` method. It is recommended to document this well following the convention in the example units.

`format` takes the dict output by `read` and outputs a string, with pango formatting, to be displayed on the statusline. This method is how output is customized - you're in charge! For well written units, the documentation should document `read`'s output, and `format` should be overwritable without delving into `read`'s inner workings.

`handle_click` takes a dict corresponding to a click event (according to the i3bar JSON API) and returns nothing. This code should a) produce useful side effects independent of the py3status control loop and/or b) modify the unit's state such that the next invocation of `read` or `format` does something usefully different. Really, do whatever.

### controlling display style

In addition to in-string display styles and colours, which are controlled by `unit.format`, global styles conforming to the i3bar JSON API can be set in three ways, in *increasing order of precedence*:

- 1) at the instantiation of the PY3Status controller, passing a style dict to the `chunk_kwargs` kwarg. This will be applied to all units.
- 2) on a per-unit basis through the `unit.permanent_overrides` dict. When the unit's output is read, the style will be updated with these parameters.
- 3) on a per-unit basis through the `unit.transient_overrides` dict. Each time the unit's output is read, the style will be updated with these parameters, *and this dictionary will be cleared by the control loop*.

## Installation

- 1) put `py3status.py` and `py3_default_units.py` in your PYTHONPATH
- 2) put `run_py3s.py` in your PATH and configure i3 to run it with `status_command run_py3s.py` in your config
- 3) edit `run_py3s.py` to your heart's content to configure the output. Write your own units, or butcher the defaults.
- !4) There should be no need to edit the control loop, however; that's the one piece of work that's done for you.

## The Future

A migration to cython is possible.
